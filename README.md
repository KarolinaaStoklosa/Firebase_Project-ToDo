# Firebase Project To-Do

This is a simple web page written in vanilla JavaScript. I used Firebase authentication to register and log in the users. You can add, remove and edit your private todos divided into four categories, they are stored in Fireabse Realtime DB. There are also possibility to create some team's todos and store them in Firebase Firestore.
